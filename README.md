# Pygame-RPGgame
An action RPG game where you save villagers from monsters.

The game was a class project of 4 people. With prior knowledge to PyGame, i suggested using this module to create
a Role-playing Game (RPG) for our Software Engineer class project as it is easy to learn and my all teammates were familiar with Python.

The game is developed with Model-View-Controller model so that we had better grasp of the whole structure whenever new elements is added.
